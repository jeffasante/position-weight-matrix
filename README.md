# position-weight-matrix
Implementation of Position weight matrix on a [DnaA 9-mers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DnaA).

## Concept
*[Position Weight Matrix or PWM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix) is one of the key bioinformatic tools used extensively in characterizing and predicting motifs in nucleotide and amino acid sequences.*

## Usage
***PWM** is frequently used to generate PWM for motif characterization and prediction. 
And can be extended to more advanced bioinformatic algorithms such as the [variable-order Bayesian network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-order_Bayesian_network), [Gibbs sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) and related algorithms based on the Monte Carlo method , MEME , and support vector machines.*
